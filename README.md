# Math Utility Application

A console application that provides various mathematical utilities. This project focuses on using **static classes and methods** to perform calculations.

## Features
- Perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Calculate factorial of a number.
- Use a static class `MathUtility` for all operations.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Run the program (`dotnet run` or `F5` in Visual Studio).
4. Follow the on-screen menu to perform calculations.

## Skills Practiced
- Static classes (e.g., `MathUtility`).
- Static methods (e.g., `Add`, `Multiply`).
- Namespaces (e.g., `MathTools`).
